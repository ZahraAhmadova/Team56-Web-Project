        This webpage project includes the
        <strong>"Hour of Code Event"</strong> and
        <strong>"Web Project"</strong> sections, designed and developed to
        showcase the activities and technical aspects of our project.
      </p>
      <h4>Hour of Code Event Section</h4>
      <p>
        The <strong>"Hour of Code Event"</strong> page documents the team’s
        session at Baku Modern School, highlighting preparation, student
        engagement, and outcomes. This section uses a multi-section layout with
        structured content, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Descriptive paragraphs detailing the event.</li>
        <li>Bulleted lists to outline challenges faced during the event.</li>
        <li>
          A <strong>contribution table</strong> summarizing individual team
          efforts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Used JavaScript:</strong> When pressed on the pictures, it
          zooms it (Modal Box)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Images from the event were integrated using the
        <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and styled with CSS to include rounded
        borders and subtle shadows. The background employs a custom
        purple-to-white gradient, ensuring a cohesive visual theme across the
        website. **CSS animations** using <code>@keyframes</code> were added to
        the headers for a smooth fade-in effect, enhancing user engagement.
      </p>
      <h4>Web Project Section</h4>
      <p>
        The <strong>"Web Project"</strong> section provides an overview of the
        tools and techniques used to build this website. Key features include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <strong>persistent navigation bar</strong> across all pages for
          seamless navigation between sections, such as "Home Page," "Hour of
          Code Event," and "Code Art."
        </li>
        <li>
          Consistent design with a purple-themed color scheme for the navigation
          bar and backgrounds.
        </li>

          such as the contribution table in the Hour of Code Event section.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This website project, which includes the
        <strong>"Home Page"</strong> and
        <strong>"About Our Team Members"</strong> sections, was developed by
        Zahra Ahmadova. The homepage serves as the introduction to the website,
        featuring key team details and welcoming visitors.
      </p>
      <h4>Home Page</h4>
      <p>
        In the <strong>index.html</strong> file, which serves as the homepage of
        the website, Zahra provided an introduction to the project and its core
        sections. The homepage includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <strong>navigation bar</strong> to ensure seamless access to all
          major sections, including "Home," "About Our Team Members," "Hour of
          Code Event," "Web Project," and "Code Art."
        </li>
        <li>
          The navigation bar persists across all pages to maintain a cohesive
          user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CSS @keyframes animations</strong> to create a visually
          engaging effect for the main heading.
        </li>
        <li>
          A custom-designed purple-to-white gradient background, ensuring a
          professional look while maintaining text readability.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Dynamic Features</h4>
      <p>
        Using JavaScript, Zahra added a custom greeting (e.g., “Good Morning,”
        “Good Evening”) that dynamically changes based on the time of day,
        adding a personal touch to the homepage.
      </p>
      <h4>About Our Team Members Page</h4>
      <p>
        In the <strong>team-members.html</strong>, Zahra provided information
        about the team members, including their individual skills and
        contributions. Key features include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A structured layout where clicking on a team member’s name reveals
          additional information, such as their major, skills, and contributions
          to the project.
        </li>
        <li>
          JavaScript toggling functionality for each team member’s information.
          Clicking on a name reveals or hides the corresponding details.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Additionally, Zahra added and animated a header for the "Hour of Code"
        section, similar to the homepage, with a header that animates letter by
        letter.
