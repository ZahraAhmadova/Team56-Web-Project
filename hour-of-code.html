        Before visiting the school, team members created a quick plan for the
        lesson we would be teaching. As Team number 56, we selected "Baku Modern
        School" for our hour-long coding event. When everything was prepared, we
        left for the school and spent an hour teaching a class of 20 students,
        including seventh graders.
      </p>
      <p>
        We introduced the students to ADA University and Code.org, explaining
        how the platform helps in understanding programming languages and
        algorithmic thinking. By using an Angry Birds-related project on
        Code.org, we made the session engaging and interactive. Students
        responded positively and showed interest in pursuing programming.
      </p>
      <h2>How did we get ready for an hour of coding?</h2>
      <p>
        This was a challenging task to prepare for. Finding a school was first
        quite difficult. We requested input from a few schools, however some did
        not reply, others requested authorisation papers from the government,
        and still others did not have enough teaching chances. We didn't have
        time because the deadline was approaching, so spending days looking for
        a school wasn't the ideal option. We thus choose which secondary school
        to meet at. Even though we choose a school, it would be chaotic and
        ineffective if we arrived without a lesson plan. The following was
        incorporated into our plan: information about ADA University in such a
        way that that about students, ADA's faculties and other options; an
        introduction to programming languages and their importance; a
        description and information about Code.org; and a fantastic finale by
        awarding them with diplomas. The simplest aspect of our preparation was
        completing the activities on Code.org as we all had prior familiarity
        with it and our HW2 was about it.

      <h2>To what extent did they advance?</h2>

          onclick="openModal(this)"

        <img

          alt="Students looking at the presentation"

      </div>
      <p>
        We utilised one of the Angry Birds-related projects from Code.org to
        demonstrate our argument. We ask kids to get up and respond to the
        following question on the board whenever we introduce a new idea.
        However, pupils found it more difficult to respond to the increasingly
        difficult level-by-level questions. We were able to assess their
        progress through the training by doing this. It was encouraging to
        observe that the majority of them were not scared to attempt, even if
        their responses were wrong, and they were growing more motivated every
        time they gave the right solution.The session was also really enjoyable
        because the kids weren't dozing off; instead, they were trying to
        provide an answer. The more they tried to answer the questions, the more
        captivating the lesson became. Students were positively impressed by
        Code.org, and several of them made the decision to stick with it in the
        future. Our presentation even pleased the class instructor, who
        expressed gratitude to us and the director for helping the instructor
        identify the gifted children. In order to inspire the students to put in
        even more effort, we also gave awards to those who actively engaged in
        the class.

      <h2>Who provided help to our team?</h2>
      <p>
        We ought to thank the principle for helping us organise this, such as
        the meeting with the children. Our team gained a lot of new knowledge
        and abilities throughout the presentation. The school gave us an
        instructor who assisted us in controlling the class quiet because we
        lacked teaching expertise. Our team is grateful to Jamil Hajiyev since
        without his assistance, we would not have been able to aid the school.
